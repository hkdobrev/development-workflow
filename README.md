Development Workflow
====================

These are my notes/slides for my talk at [Bulgaria Web Summit 2014][Bulgaria Web Summit].

Progress
--------

I am still not sure if I would create a conventional presentation with slides and everything.
For now these are just structures (and not so structured) notes with what I would talk about.


Contents
--------

1. Git - source control - keep everything tidy.
2. Unit tests - Keep it less buggy.
3. GitHub - Pull requests, code review and [The GitHub Flow™][].
4. Continuous integration - Automated testing and deployment. Keep the loop small.
5. Bring everything together.
