What is Git?
------------

Git is a source control management solution.

Some people think source control is about backups and not loosing things.

It is not (just) about that.

It is about:

- Keep a history of what happened and who did what.
- Experiment often.
- Rollback, revert and merge changes.
- Asynchronous development of several features.
- Maintaining several versions.
- Find which change introduced that nasty bug.
- Much, much more...

Why?

This is not just another thing to add to the stuff developers need to know.

If used correctly, it could improve your entire workflow.

1. Offline/Locally
   With its offline capabilities Git enables you not only to work when you are
   not connected to the internet. It actually gives you the power of local
   revision control before you have shared anything with other people.
   You could experiment all the time with commits and branches without caring if
   your work would be seen by others before it's ready.

2. Fast
